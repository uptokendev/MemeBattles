title: UpVotes for traders
description: When to UpVote, what it changes, and how to interpret UpVotes.
---

UpVotes are paid discovery. They can be used by anyone — traders, creators, communities.

If you haven’t read the base concept, start here: **[Core Concepts → UpVotes](/core-concepts/upvotes)**.

## Why traders UpVote
Traders UpVote for two reasons:
1. **Visibility**: push a campaign into more eyes (more volume can mean more volatility)
2. **Coordination**: communities signal “we’re behind this” on-chain

## When UpVotes tend to work best
- The campaign is early and competing for attention
- The campaign has a real community pushing content + holders
- There is a clear narrative (memes without narrative die fast)

## When UpVotes are usually wasted
- The campaign already has huge volume and is already visible
- You’re trying to “buy a pump” without a community behind it

## Interpreting UpVotes as a signal
UpVotes show that someone spent BNB for attention, but:
- it’s not verification
- it’s not a quality score
- it can be gamed

Use it as *one* data point, not as your thesis.
