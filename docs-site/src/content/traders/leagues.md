title: Leagues for traders
description: How trader leaderboards work and how to compete.

Leagues are epoch-based competitions. Some leagues reward **campaigns/creators**, others reward **traders**.

Start with the basics: **[Core Concepts → Leagues](/core-concepts/leagues)**.

## Epoch timing
- Weekly epochs run Monday 00:00 UTC → next Monday 00:00 UTC.
- Monthly epochs run 1st of month 00:00 UTC → next 1st.

Standings can change live, but winners are locked at cutoff.

## What trader leagues measure
The exact categories can vary by season, but common trader metrics include:
- **Top earner** (realized/unrealized PnL, as defined by the league)
- **Best single trade** (biggest win)
- **Most active** (volume or number of trades)

Always rely on the league card/rules shown in-app for the current season.

## How to compete (practical)
- Trade on-campaigns you actually understand (narrative + community)
- Keep a gas buffer so you can exit and claim
- Don’t chase every move; trader leagues reward discipline over randomness

## How rewards are paid
Rewards are claimed on-chain by eligible wallets. See **[Claiming rewards](/traders/claiming-rewards)**.
