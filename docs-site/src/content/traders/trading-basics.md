This is the minimum you should know before placing trades on MemeBattles.

## What you’re trading
During the pre-graduation phase, you trade against a **bonding curve** using BNB.
- There is no order book.
- Your trade changes the price.

If you haven’t yet, read **[Bonding Curve](/core-concepts/bonding-curve)**.

## Buying (step-by-step)
1. Open a campaign page.
2. Enter the amount of BNB you want to spend.
3. Review the quote (expected tokens, price impact).
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Selling (step-by-step)
1. Open the same campaign page.
2. Enter the amount of tokens you want to sell.
3. Review the expected BNB output.
4. Confirm in your wallet.

## Slippage, price impact, and failed tx
**Price impact** is the price movement caused by your own trade. Large orders move the curve more.

**Slippage** is your tolerance for the quote changing between click and confirmation.

If a trade fails:
- the market may have moved
- your slippage may be too low
- you may not have enough BNB for gas

## Gas basics (BNB)
Every on-chain action costs gas. Keep a small BNB buffer so you can:
- buy/sell
- UpVote
- claim rewards

## Fees (high level)
Trades include a fee on buys and sells. Fees also help fund leagues and creator earnings.
See **[Fees & Treasury](/core-concepts/fees-and-treasury)**.
