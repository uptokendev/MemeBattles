description: How to claim league rewards (and why claims are wallet-bound).
---

Rewards are claimable on-chain. That means:
- the claiming wallet must be the wallet that earned the reward
- you need a bit of BNB for gas

## Step-by-step
1. Connect the wallet that earned the reward.
2. Open the **Leagues** section or the campaign/league page showing your reward.
3. If a **Claim** button is available, click it.
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
5. Wait for confirmation; the reward will arrive after the tx is mined.

## Why rewards are wallet-bound
Wallet-bound claims are safer because they:
- reduce manual payouts
- prevent reward redirection
- make rewards provable on-chain

## Troubleshooting
**I don’t see a claim button:**
- the epoch may not be finalized yet
- you may be on the wrong wallet

**Claim tx fails:**
- check you have enough BNB for gas
- retry after a short wait if the chain is congested
