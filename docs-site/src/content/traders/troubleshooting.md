## Transaction is pending
- Give it a few minutes; chain load can spike.
- Your wallet may allow **Speed up** (higher gas) or **Cancel**.

## Buy/Sell fails
Common reasons:
- **slippage too low** during fast activity
- **not enough BNB** for gas
- **order too large** (price impact moves the curve)

What to do:
- retry with a slightly higher slippage
- reduce order size
- keep a BNB gas buffer

## Balance doesn’t update
- Refresh the page.
- Make sure you’re connected with the correct wallet.
- Confirm the transaction shows as successful in your wallet history.

## I can’t find a campaign
- Verify you are on the correct site/domain.
- Use search / sort (New, Trending).

## Suspected scam / fake link
- Do not connect your wallet.
- Do not sign messages you don’t understand.
- Only use official channels and bookmarked links.
