MemeBattles is a **launchpad + trading arena** on **BNB Chain**. You can trade tokens on their bonding curve, help campaigns get discovered via **UpVotes**, and compete in **Leagues**.

This guide gets you from zero → first trade with the common gotchas covered.

## What you need
- A crypto wallet (recommended: **Rabby** or **MetaMask**)
- A small amount of **BNB** for network fees (“gas”)
- A safe browsing setup (bookmark the official domain, avoid fake links)

## 1) Install a wallet
1. Install **Rabby** (recommended) or **MetaMask**.
2. Create a new wallet.
3. **Write down your seed phrase offline** (paper / password manager). Never share it.

## 2) Connect to BNB Chain
Most wallets can auto-detect BNB Chain. If not:
- In your wallet, add/switch network to **BNB Chain**.

## 3) Get BNB (gas + trading)
You’ll need BNB for:
- **Gas** (every on-chain action costs a small fee)
- **Trades** (campaigns are bought/sold against BNB)
- **UpVotes** (paid discovery)

Any exchange that supports BNB Chain can be used. Withdraw BNB to your wallet address.

## 4) Open MemeBattles and connect
1. Go to the MemeBattles site.
2. Click **Connect Wallet**.
3. Approve the connection request in your wallet.

**Safety tip:** always verify you’re on the correct domain before connecting.

## 5) Find a campaign
On the homepage you’ll typically see:
- **New** / **Trending** / **Ending Soon**
- A campaign grid with stats like market cap, volume, and bonding-curve progress

Click a campaign to open the token page:
- Chart + recent trades
- Buy/Sell panel
- UpVote button
- League info (if active)

## 6) Buy and sell (basic flow)
### Buy
1. Enter the amount of BNB you want to spend.
2. Check **price impact / expected output**.
3. Confirm in your wallet.

### Sell
1. Enter the amount of tokens you want to sell.
2. Review the expected BNB output.
3. Confirm in your wallet.

### Slippage and “price impact”
Bonding curves move the price as you trade:
- Bigger orders usually mean **more price impact**.
- If a transaction fails, you may need **slightly higher slippage** (especially in fast markets).

## 7) Use UpVotes
UpVotes are a paid discovery mechanic:
- They help campaigns climb visibility/trending surfaces.
- They are best used when a campaign is **early** and needs momentum.

UpVotes are on-chain and require BNB.

## 8) Leagues and rewards
Leagues are competitive epochs (weekly/monthly) funded by protocol activity:
- Campaigns and traders compete on defined metrics.
- Winners can **claim rewards** at/after epoch finalization.

If you don’t see your rewards immediately, check:
- You’re connected with the **same wallet** that earned them.
- The epoch has ended/finalized.

## Security checklist (read this)
- **Never** share your seed phrase.
- Bookmark the official MemeBattles domain.
- Don’t trust DMs “from staff.”
- Verify token/campaign pages—memecoins are high-risk.
- If a wallet pop-up looks unusual, **reject** and refresh.

## Troubleshooting
**Tx stuck / pending:** wait a few minutes; if it doesn’t confirm, your wallet may let you speed up / cancel.

**Wrong chain:** switch to **BNB Chain** in your wallet and retry.

**Balance not updating:** refresh the page; if it’s still wrong, check the transaction status in your wallet.
