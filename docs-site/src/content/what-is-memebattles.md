# What is MemeBattles?

MemeBattles is a **meme launchpad** where every token launch becomes a **campaign** that can compete in a **battle arena**.

Think of it as:

- **Launchpad**: create a token and start a public sale instantly
- **Market**: trade the token while the price follows a bonding curve
- **Discovery layer**: UpVotes push campaigns into featured positions
- **Competition layer**: Leagues run on epochs (weekly/monthly) and distribute prizes

## The campaign lifecycle (high level)

1. **Create** — a creator launches a campaign (token + bonding curve)
2. **Trade** — users buy/sell against the curve, price updates transparently
3. **UpVote** — the community boosts visibility for campaigns they support
4. **Graduate** — once the campaign hits the graduation threshold, it finalizes and transitions to AMM liquidity
5. **Compete** — campaigns and traders earn rankings inside Leagues and can claim prizes

- pricing → **How it works → Bonding curve**
- post-threshold transition → **How it works → Graduation**
