# Why we built MemeBattles

Most meme launchpads optimize for **platform extraction**:

- creators pay to launch, pay to promote, and still get buried
- traders get short-term hype cycles and zero long-term game loop
- the platform takes fees, but value doesn’t flow back to the people who make the platform valuable

We built MemeBattles around a simple idea:

> **Creators and traders *are* the launchpad.**

So the protocol is designed to:

## 1) Fix discovery
Discovery on meme launchpads often turns into pay-to-play shilling.

MemeBattles replaces that with **UpVotes** — a clear, on-chain way to show support and push campaigns up the rankings.

## 2) Make launches a game people want to come back to
We add **Leagues** (weekly + monthly competitions) that turn trading and creator performance into a **repeatable loop**.

Winners get rewarded. Campaigns get spotlight. The ecosystem stays alive.

## 3) Keep the money flow transparent
We use a treasury model with clear wallet roles (Owners Safe vs Ops Safe) and a distribution policy that prioritizes sustainability and accountability.

If you want the mechanics, start with:

- **What is MemeBattles?**
- **What problem does it solve?**
- **Fees** and **Treasury**
