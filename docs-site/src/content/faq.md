## Getting Started

### What is MemeBattles?
MemeBattles is a creator-first memecoin launchpad that combines:
- a bonding-curve launch phase
- paid discovery (UpVotes)
- competitive Leagues that reward creators and traders

### What do I need to use MemeBattles?
- A Web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask)
- A small amount of BNB for gas
- The official site: memebattles.gg

### Which chain do you support?
At launch we focus on BSC (BNB Chain). Your wallet must be on the same network as the app.

### What is a campaign?
A campaign is a token launch page with trading and progression to graduation.

## Trading

### What fees do I pay when trading?
Trading fees are **2% on buys** and **2% on sells**.

### Where does the trading fee go?
From each trade amount T:
- **0.75% of T** funds the League Treasury
- the remaining portion goes to protocol revenue

### What is the bonding curve and why does price move fast?
During the launch phase, price is determined by a bonding curve. Early liquidity is thin and price impact is higher.

### Why did my trade fail?
Most common reasons:
- slippage too low during volatility
- not enough BNB for gas
- RPC congestion

## UpVotes

### What is an UpVote?
An UpVote is a paid visibility boost for a campaign.

### How much does an UpVote cost?
**0.003 BNB** per UpVote.

### Can UpVotes be refunded?
No. An UpVote is a paid action that immediately affects ranking/visibility.

## For Creators

### How do I create a campaign?
Use the **Create** flow in the app and follow this guide: **[Create a campaign](/creators/create-a-campaign)**.

### Do I need KYC?
No KYC is required by default. Traders will still judge credibility by your socials and launch behavior.

### What makes a good launch?
Short version:
- clear identity (logo, name, socials)
- one canonical link
- active community presence in the first hour

See: **[Branding & best practices](/creators/branding-best-practices)**.

## Graduation

### What is graduation?
Graduation is the milestone where a campaign reaches **50 BNB raised** and transitions from launch phase to post-graduation liquidity.

### What is the finalize fee?
At graduation a **2% finalize fee** is taken from the raised amount before the liquidity split.

### What does the creator receive at graduation?
After the 2% finalize fee, the remainder is split:
- **80%** to liquidity
- **20%** to the creator

At the 50 BNB threshold, that means the creator receives **9.8 BNB**.

## Leagues and Rewards

### What are Leagues?
Leagues are recurring competitions (weekly/monthly) that reward performance and create ongoing attention for campaigns.

### How are prize pools funded?
Leagues are funded by the **0.75%** slice from trades.

### When can I claim rewards?
Claims become available after the relevant league/epoch completes and winners are finalized.

## Fees and Economics

### Can you summarize all fees?
- Trading: 2% buy, 2% sell
- UpVote: 0.003 BNB
- Graduation finalize: 2% of raised

### Where do protocol revenues go?
Protocol revenue flows to the **Owners Safe** first and is distributed on a weekly cadence. See: **[Treasury](/treasury)**.

## Treasury and Transparency

### What is the Owners Safe?
The Owners Safe is the main multisig treasury that receives protocol revenues.

### What is the Ops Safe?
Ops Safe is a capped operations wallet (held around 50 BNB) used for predictable operating expenses.

### How often do you distribute revenue?
Weekly, using a fixed policy (top up Ops Safe to its target, retain buffer, distribute the remainder).

## Security and Safety

### Is this risky?
Yes. Memecoins are highly volatile and you should assume you can lose your entire position.

### How do I avoid scams and fake links?
- do not trust DMs
- use only official links
- verify the creator's official socials

See: **[Avoid scams](/security/avoid-scams)**.

### Do you have a status page?
Not yet. It is planned. Until then, rely on official announcements.

## Troubleshooting

### I do not see my claim yet
Common reasons:
- the league epoch is not finalized
- indexer lag during high activity
- you are on the wrong network

### The UI is not updating
Hard refresh, confirm wallet network, and try again. During congestion, on-chain confirmations can lag.
