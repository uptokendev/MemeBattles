# What problem does MemeBattles solve?

Meme coins are not “serious finance”, but the **market mechanics are real** — and the incentives in most launchpads are broken.

Here’s what we’re fixing.

## Problem 1 — Creators get squeezed
On many platforms creators:

- pay to launch
- pay to promote
- fight for visibility against bots + paid shillers
- end up with little upside unless they become full-time marketers

**Our fix:** discovery + distribution designed for creators: **UpVotes** + **Leagues** create repeat exposure and winner spotlights, which drives followers and repeat traffic.

## Problem 2 — Discovery is opaque and gameable
Trending pages are often:

- a black box
- dominated by insiders
- manipulated through off-chain deals

**Our fix:** UpVotes are an explicit action. You can see campaigns earn visibility through community support.

## Problem 3 — There’s no durable game loop
Most launches are a one-and-done:

- a spike
- then attention moves on
- the platform still earns, but the ecosystem decays

**Our fix:** Leagues introduce a recurring loop (weekly/monthly epochs). The market stays active because there is always an ongoing competition.

## Problem 4 — “Where does the money go?” is unclear
Users and creators deserve to understand the economics:

- what fees exist
- why they exist
- how they are used

**Our fix:** we document fee flows, treasury roles, and distribution policy in plain language.

Next reads:

- **Fees** → the full fee model and examples
- **Treasury** → Owners/Ops safes and distribution policy
- **Leagues** → how prize pools and claims work
