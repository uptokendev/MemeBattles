## Who can claim
Only the wallet that earned a reward can claim it.

## When you can claim
Claims become available once the epoch is **finalized** (after the cutoff) and the winners are computed.

## Claim expiry
Claims remain available for **90 days after epoch end**.

If a claim expires, the unclaimed amount is rolled back into the next epoch's prize pool.
