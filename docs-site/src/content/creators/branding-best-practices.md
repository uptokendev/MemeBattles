## What works
### 1) Recognizable identity
- simple logo, high contrast
- consistent colors across all socials
- readable symbol

### 2) One clear sentence
Your project needs one repeatable line that’s true.

### 3) Proof you’re real
Signals traders look for:
- active X account
- Telegram with pinned links
- consistent identity and announcements

### 4) 24-hour plan
- T-30: announce time + link
- T+0: launch + CTA (UpVote + share)
- T+15: milestone post
- T+60: community momentum
- T+6h: recap + next action

### 5) Community ops
- pin official links
- “no DMs from staff”
- mods for first 24h
- rules against impersonation

## What MemeBattles rewards
- UpVotes (visibility)
- consistent trading activity (leagues/rankings)
