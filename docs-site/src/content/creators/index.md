description: Launch a campaign, reach graduation, earn as a creator, and build a real following.

MemeBattles is built for **creators who want a fair launch** and a **growth loop** after launch.

## Recommended order
1. **[Create a campaign](/creators/create-a-campaign)**
2. **[Branding & best practices](/creators/branding-best-practices)**
3. **[Graduation: what happens](/creators/graduation)**
4. **[Creator earnings](/creators/creator-earnings)**
5. **[The growth loop](/creators/growth-loop)**

## What creators get that most launchpads don’t
MemeBattles is structured so creators benefit when they succeed:
- discovery via **UpVotes**
- recurring attention via **Leagues**
- predictable **Treasury policy** (Owners Safe → weekly cadence)
