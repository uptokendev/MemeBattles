title: Create a campaign (step-by-step)
description: From idea → live campaign in minutes.
---

## Before you click Create
Have these ready:
- **Name + symbol**
- **Logo** (square PNG)
- **One-liner** (8–12 words)
- **Links**: X/Twitter, Telegram, website
- **Launch plan** (first 24h)

## Step 1 — Connect your wallet
Connect the wallet you want as **creator wallet** and confirm you’re on the supported chain.

## Step 2 — Open Create Campaign
Click **Create** and fill:
- name / symbol
- logo / banner
- description
- social links

## Step 3 — Set identity (important)
Traders judge legitimacy in seconds:
- clarity > cleverness
- real description (not “next 100x”)
- official socials so users can verify it’s you

## Step 4 — Understand the economics (simple)
Campaign trades on a **bonding curve**, then **graduates** at a fixed threshold.

Read:
- **[Bonding Curve](/core-concepts/bonding-curve)**
- **[Graduation](/core-concepts/graduation)**

## Step 5 — Deploy
Confirm the wallet transaction.

After confirmation:
- campaign appears in the grid
- trading starts immediately
- it can be UpVoted and compete in Leagues

## Step 6 — 15-minute launch hygiene
1. Pin official campaign link (X + Telegram)
2. Post one canonical link (avoid fake copies)
3. Ask community to UpVote early
4. Be present in chat for the first hour
