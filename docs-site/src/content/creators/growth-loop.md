title: Growth loop
description: How UpVotes + Leagues turn one-and-done launches into repeatable attention.
---

## Loop 1 — UpVote-driven discovery
UpVotes are paid visibility boosts:
- creators + traders both want visibility
- transparent ranking competition

## Loop 2 — League-driven retention
Leagues create recurring cycles:
- epochs (weekly/monthly)
- winners + prize pools
- announcement moments that drive followers

## Creator playbook
1) launch clean
2) push early UpVotes
3) stay present while trading builds
4) graduate → announce hard
5) ride the next league cycle
