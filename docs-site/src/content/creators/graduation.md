description: The graduation moment is where creator-first economics kick in.

## Threshold
- **Graduation happens at 50 BNB raised**
- a **finalize** action executes

## Finalize fee
- **2% of raised liquidity** (taken before liquidity is created)

Example at threshold:
- Raised: 50 BNB
- Fee: 2% × 50 = **1.0 BNB**
- Remaining: 49 BNB

## Split after fee
- **80% → liquidity pool**
- **20% → creator payout**

Example at threshold:
- Creator: 20% × 49 = **9.8 BNB**
- Liquidity: 80% × 49 = **39.2 BNB**

## What to do immediately
- announce “Graduated ✅”
- pin updated trading link
- watch for impersonators
