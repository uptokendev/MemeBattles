title: Fees & Treasury
description: What you pay, and where it goes.

MemeBattles is designed so fees don’t only reward the platform — they also fund **league prize pools** and **creator earnings**.

## The core fees (high level)
- **Trading**: a fee on buys and sells (currently **2% buy** and **2% sell**)
- **UpVotes**: a fixed on-chain fee (currently **0.003 BNB**)
- **Graduation**: a finalize fee at graduation (currently **2%**)

## League Treasury share (simple)
A portion of each trade is routed to the **League Treasury** to fund prizes (currently **0.75% of trade notional**).

## Prize pool budgeting (fair & predictable)
- **30% of League fees** fund **weekly** rewards (4 categories, 1 winner each).
- **70% of League fees** fund **monthly** rewards (5 categories, top 5 each).
- Monthly budget is split **equally** between all 5 leagues (including **Perfect Run**, which is monthly-only).

## Treasury model (plain English)
Protocol revenue is designed to flow into secure custody and be distributed on a clear schedule:
- **Owners Safe**: main revenue custody (multisig)
- **Ops Safe**: capped operational wallet

This keeps “operating cash” small and limits blast radius if an ops wallet is compromised.
