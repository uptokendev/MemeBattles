title: UpVotes
description: Paid discovery that moves a campaign’s visibility.
---

**UpVotes** are MemeBattles’ discovery primitive. Instead of hidden pay-to-play listings, visibility is earned in public via on-chain UpVotes.

## What an UpVote does
An UpVote increases a campaign’s visibility on surfaces like:
- featured/trending grids
- league-related spotlight sections

It’s designed to let communities signal support without needing off-platform agreements.

## Cost
An UpVote costs a fixed amount (currently **0.003 BNB**) and is paid on-chain.

## What UpVotes are not
- Not a guarantee of performance
- Not a “verified” badge
- Not refundable

## How to use UpVotes well
- Early campaigns benefit most because they’re competing for attention.
- If a campaign already has large volume, UpVotes tend to have less marginal effect.

## A trader’s perspective
UpVotes can be a useful data point (someone paid to push visibility), but treat it as **momentum**, not due diligence.
