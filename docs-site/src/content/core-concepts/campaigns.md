In MemeBattles, a **campaign** is the unit of creation and competition: a token launched by a creator, with a public token page where trading, discovery, and league performance are tracked.

A campaign combines:
1. **Token identity** (name, ticker, image, creator)
2. **A market on a bonding curve** (buy/sell against BNB)
3. **Progress toward graduation** (how far the curve has filled)
4. **Discovery** (UpVotes + trending surfaces)
5. **Competition** (Leagues that rank campaigns and traders)

## What you’ll see on a campaign page
Typical sections:
- **Chart + price**: the bonding curve price changes as people buy/sell.
- **Buy/Sell panel**: trade against the curve.
- **Curve progress**: how close the campaign is to graduation.
- **Activity**: recent trades and volume (where available).
- **UpVote**: paid visibility to help a campaign get discovered.
- **Leagues**: whether the campaign is currently competing and how it’s doing.

## What the creator controls (and what they don’t)
Creators control:
- Campaign metadata (branding, links, description)
- Their own marketing and community

Creators do **not** control:
- The market price once trading starts (the curve + trading activity does)
- Whether traders can buy/sell (it’s on-chain)

## The campaign lifecycle (high level)
1. **Created**: token + campaign page exists.
2. **Trading on the curve**: price moves as supply changes.
3. **Graduation**: when the campaign hits the graduation target, it transitions to post-graduation liquidity.
4. **After graduation**: trading continues in the broader market; leagues may continue to track performance depending on the season rules.

## What to check before trading
- Does the creator identity look consistent (profile + socials)?
- Is the campaign early or late on the curve? (late can be more volatile)
- Are you sizing the trade for memecoin-level risk?
