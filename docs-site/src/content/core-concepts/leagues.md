description: Weekly/monthly competitions funded by protocol activity.

Leagues turn launches into a competitive game where **creators** and **traders** can win rewards.

## What a league is
A league is an **epoch** (time window) with:
- a start time
- an end time
- a prize pool
- a set of winning metrics

Common epoch types:
- **Weekly**: Monday 00:00 UTC → next Monday 00:00 UTC
- **Monthly**: 1st of month 00:00 UTC → next 1st 00:00 UTC

## Where the prize pool comes from
The prize pool is funded by protocol activity (for example, a portion of trading fees routed to the **League Treasury**).

## Winners and finalization
During the epoch, standings can move. At the cutoff:
- winners are finalized
- winners can claim their rewards

## Why this matters
Leagues create a loop:
- more trading activity → bigger prize pools
- winners get promoted → creators get followers
- more attention → more launches
