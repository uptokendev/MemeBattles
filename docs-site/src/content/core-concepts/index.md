description: The mental model for how MemeBattles works.
---

If you understand these concepts, everything else in MemeBattles becomes easy.

## The 60-second overview
1. A **Creator** launches a **Campaign** (a token) in seconds.
2. Traders buy/sell on a **bonding curve**.
3. As the curve fills, the campaign approaches **Graduation**.
4. Discovery is driven by **UpVotes** and competitive **Leagues**.
5. Fees fund **creator earnings**, **league prize pools**, and **protocol operations**.

## Concepts (recommended reading order)
- **[Campaigns](/core-concepts/campaigns)** — what you’re trading and what “launching” means.
- **[Bonding Curve](/core-concepts/bonding-curve)** — why the price changes as people trade.
- **[Graduation](/core-concepts/graduation)** — what happens when a campaign “makes it.”
- **[UpVotes](/core-concepts/upvotes)** — paid discovery that moves visibility.
- **[Leagues](/core-concepts/leagues)** — weekly/monthly competitions funded by activity.
- **[Fees & Treasury](/core-concepts/fees-and-treasury)** — where the money goes (plain English).
- **[Claims](/core-concepts/claims)** — how eligible wallets collect rewards.
